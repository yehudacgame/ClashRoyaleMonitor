## Reviewer Notes Template

```
Dear App Review Team,

ClashRoyale Tower Monitor is a utility app that helps Clash Royale players track their game performance through real-time tower destruction detection.

Key testing points:
1. The app requires Clash Royale to be installed for full functionality
2. Screen recording permission is essential - please enable when prompted
3. The broadcast extension (ClashRoyale Monitor) should appear in Control Center screen recording options
4. All video processing happens locally - no data is transmitted externally
5. Test with sample text recognition in Settings > Debug > Test Notification

The app provides genuine utility for Clash Royale players and does not replicate game functionality, instead offering performance tracking and statistics.

Please contact review@clashmonitor.app with any questions.

Thank you for your review.
```
